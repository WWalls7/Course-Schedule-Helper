## Course Schedule Helper

This project is a web application designed to improve the training course scheduling process for employees of FDM. 

The application is designed to be primarily used by course scheduling employees to create courses and allocate training staff. Training staff use the application to review their upcoming schedules and make schedule change requests. Separate web interfaces have been used for the two types of employees. 

## Implementation

The web application was developed using React, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Firebase. 

Development was completed by myself (Wendy Walls) with background image styling and font adjustments made by two other group members.  

## Schedulers

The dashboard for schedulers contains a central calendar containing all of the courses that have been scheduled. Schedulers use the system to create and manage courses, approve/reject trainer schedule change requests, view employee contact information, and update their personal profile. Each event on the central calendar is clickable and opens a descriptive modal allowing users to review and edit courses. Course operations include: add/remove trainers from course, update course details, and delete course. 

## Trainers

The dashboard for trainers consists of a personal calendar containing all of the courses that have been assigned to that particular trainer. Trainers use the system to review their schedule, make reschedule requests,  view all schedule requests, view update notifications for courses they have been assigned to, view employee contact information, and update their personal profile. Each event on the personal calendar is clickable and opens a descriptive modal allowing users to review course descriptions and request reschedule changes.
